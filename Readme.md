# Simple Game Programming

Just trying to put together some ideas for enabling beginners to write simple accessible browser-based games.

I'm considering a FSM as the fundamental idea but perhaps with the idea of _state_ generalized to _guard_.

Perhaps something like _mobx_ for triggering functions?

And async/await for synchonous behavior?

I'm going to try to sketch out some simple game ideas.
